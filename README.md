That is a fusion between foundation5.5.2 - CodeIgniter2 - IonAuth2

    Add to Data Base ion_auth.sql from sql_DB folder
    Update datas on application/config/database.php
    Update $config['encryption_key'] = ''; with some encryption_key that you like and remember on application/config/config.php
    Finally change $route['default_controller'] = "auth"; on application/config/routes.php

AND RUN!
